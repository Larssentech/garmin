Overview
========
QBoard is a simple widget to implement a basic soft keyboard for Garmin devices with a large screen, such s the GPSMAP 66i.

As such, it is just a demonstrator of the approach and something I just wanted to do. I am aware Garmin already have a keyboard for entering text, for example using the InReach App, still it was an interesting challenge.

QBoard implements:
- A soft keyboard
- A text area that breaks lines to fit inside the specified space

Licensing
=========
All the code is subject to the MIT license agreement. Qboard does not directly use anybody else's code, but anyone can use it for whatever purposes subject to the MIT license terms.

Authors

Lars Andersson from Larssentech Labs. It would be interesting for me to know if anyone finds this Widget useful for anything. You can contact me at 'software@larssentech.org'.
